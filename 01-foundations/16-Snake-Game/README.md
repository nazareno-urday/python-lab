## 🎮 About the game

A classic Snake game developed entirely with Python's standard-library `turtle` module.

Control the snake, collect the blue food, and grow one segment at a time. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own body.

## 🕹️ Controls

| Key | Movement |
|:---:|:---|
| <kbd>↑</kbd> | Up |
| <kbd>↓</kbd> | Down |
| <kbd>←</kbd> | Left |
| <kbd>→</kbd> | Right |

Opposite-direction turns are blocked to prevent the snake from reversing into itself.

## ✨ Features

- Smooth continuous movement
- Keyboard direction controls
- Random food placement
- Snake growth after collecting food
- Live score tracking
- Wall collision detection
- Self-collision detection
- Game-over screen
- Modular object-oriented design
